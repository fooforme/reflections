What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git begins to track all file/folder changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where files that are ready to be added to the repository are placed.
The working directory is the location of project files for the point in time or commit checked out.
Having these two locations differ allows for changes to not be introduced in a commit unless certain they are needed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Ensure that there are not a large amount of changes present in the staging area. Keep things simple and concise.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches allow for development to take place outside of the main flow. It allows for tests to be run or feature fixes to be tested before implamentation. Branches allow for code to be changed safely without impacting the main production code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They can show the relationships between the master branch and the rest of the projects branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
the result is the changes are combined into one fileset.
