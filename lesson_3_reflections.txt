When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remotes are useful for backups and also when working with other team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There are times when your codebase is not ready for new additions locally, an auto pull could create bugs.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of a fileset directly on Github
Clones are pulling a copy of a remote fileset -> to a local machine
Branches are isolated and tagged, development timelines that do not effect one another
